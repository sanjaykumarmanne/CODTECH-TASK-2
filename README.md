## Overview

The Online Banking System is designed to provide users with the ability to manage their bank accounts conveniently. The system allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, transfer money between accounts, view transaction history, and manage personal information. The application will use Java as the primary programming language and will include functionalities such as user authentication, account management, transaction processing, and data storage.

### Key Activities

1. Requirements Gathering and Analysis
   - Define the system requirements and features.
   - Identify the different types of users (e.g., customers, administrators) and their respective functionalities.

2. System Design
   - Design the system architecture, including the classes and their relationships.
   - Create use case diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams to model the system.
   - Design the database schema for storing user and transaction data.

3. Setting Up Development Environment
   - Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
   - Set up version control using Git.

4. Implementation of Core Features
   - User Authentication and Account Management
     - Implement registration and login functionalities.
     - Allow users to update their personal information.
   - Account Operations
     - Implement deposit and withdrawal functionalities.
     - Ensure that balance checks and validations are in place.
   - Fund Transfer
     - Implement the ability to transfer funds between accounts.
     - Ensure proper validations and balance checks.
   - Transaction History
     - Implement functionality to view and filter transaction history.
     - Store transaction details securely.

5. Database Integration
   - Set up a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store user and transaction data.
   - Implement data access objects (DAOs) for interacting with the database.
   - Use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database operations.

6. User Interface
   - Implement a simple command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing for user interactions.
   - Ensure the interface is user-friendly and intuitive.

7. Error Handling and Validation
   - Implement robust error handling and input validation to ensure data integrity and security.
   - Provide meaningful error messages to users.

8. Testing and Debugging
   - Write unit tests for individual components using JUnit.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure that all components work together as expected.
   - Debug and fix any issues that arise during testing.

9. Documentation
   - Document the code with comments and Javadoc.
   - Create user manuals and system documentation.

### Used Technologies

1. Programming Language
   - Java

2. Database
   - MySQL or PostgreSQL

3. Frameworks and Libraries
   - JDBC for database connectivity
   - JUnit for testing
   - JavaFX or Swing for GUI (optional)

4. Development Tools
   - IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse IDE
   - Git for version control

5. Build Tools
   - Maven or Gradle for project management and dependencies
